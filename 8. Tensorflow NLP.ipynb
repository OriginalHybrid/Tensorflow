    "# Natural Language Processing with TensorFlow\n",
    "\n",
    "The main goal of [natural language processing (NLP)](https://becominghuman.ai/a-simple-introduction-to-natural-language-processing-ea66a1747b32) is to derive information from natural language.\n",
    "\n",
    "Natural language is a broad term but you can consider it to cover any of the following:\n",
    "* Text (such as that contained in an email, blog post, book, Tweet)\n",
    "* Speech (a conversation you have with a doctor, voice commands you give to a smart speaker)\n",
    "\n",
    "Under the umbrellas of text and speech there are many different things you might want to do.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you're building an email application, you might want to scan incoming emails to see if they're spam or not spam (classification).\n",
    "\n",
    "If you're trying to analyse customer feedback complaints, you might want to discover which section of your business they're for.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Note:** Both of these types of data are often referred to as *sequences* (a sentence is a sequence of words). So a common term you'll come across in NLP problems is called *seq2seq*, in other words, finding information in one sequence to produce another sequence (e.g. converting a speech command to a sequence of text-based steps).\n",
    "\n",
    "To get hands-on with NLP in TensorFlow, we're going to practice the steps we've used previously but this time with text data:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Text -> turn into numbers -> build a model -> train the model to find patterns -> use patterns (make predictions)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "> 📖 **Resource:** For a great overview of NLP and the different problems within it, read the article [*A Simple Introduction to Natural Language Processing*](https://becominghuman.ai/a-simple-introduction-to-natural-language-processing-ea66a1747b32).\n",

    "* Converting text into numbers using tokenization\n",
    "* Turning our tokenized text into an embedding\n",
    "* Modelling a text dataset\n",
    "  * Starting with a baseline (TF-IDF)\n",
    "  * Building several deep learning text models\n",
    "    * **Dense, LSTM, GRU, Conv1D, Transfer learning**\n",
    "* Comparing the performance of each our models\n",
    "* Combining our models into an ensemble\n",
    "* Saving and loading a trained model\n",

    "We've got a training set and a validation set containing Tweets and labels.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our labels are in numerical form (`0` and `1`) but our Tweets are in string form.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Question:** What do you think we have to do before we can use a machine learning algorithm with our text data? \n",
    "\n",
    "If you answered something along the lines of \"turn it into numbers\", you're correct. A machine learning algorithm requires its inputs to be in numerical form.\n",
    "\n",
    "In NLP, there are two main concepts for turning text into numbers:\n",
    "* **Tokenization** - A straight mapping from word or character or sub-word to a numerical value. There are three main levels of tokenization:\n",
    "  1. Using **word-level tokenization** with the sentence \"I love TensorFlow\" might result in \"I\" being `0`, \"love\" being `1` and \"TensorFlow\" being `2`. In this case, every word in a sequence considered a single **token**.\n",
    "  2. **Character-level tokenization**, such as converting the letters A-Z to values `1-26`. In this case, every character in a sequence considered a single **token**.\n",
    "  3. **Sub-word tokenization** is in between word-level and character-level tokenization. It involves breaking invidual words into smaller parts and then converting those smaller parts into numbers. For example, \"my favourite food is pineapple pizza\" might become \"my, fav, avour, rite, fo, oo, od, is, pin, ine, app, le, piz, za\". After doing this, these sub-words would then be mapped to a numerical value. In this case, every word could be considered multiple **tokens**.\n",
    "* **Embeddings** - An embedding is a representation of natural language which can be learned. Representation comes in the form of a **feature vector**. For example, the word \"dance\" could be represented by the 5-dimensional vector `[-0.8547, 0.4559, -0.3332, 0.9877, 0.1112]`. It's important to note here, the size of the feature vector is tuneable. There are two ways to use embeddings: \n",
    "  1. **Create your own embedding** - Once your text has been turned into numbers (required for an embedding), you can put them through an embedding layer (such as [`tf.keras.layers.Embedding`](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/layers/Embedding)) and an embedding representation will be learned during model training.\n",
    "  2. **Reuse a pre-learned embedding** - Many pre-trained embeddings exist online. These pre-trained embeddings have often been learned on large corpuses of text (such as all of Wikipedia) and thus have a good underlying representation of natural language. You can use a pre-trained embedding to initialize your model and fine-tune it to your own specific task.\n",
    "\n",
    "![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mrdbourke/tensorflow-deep-learning/main/images/08-tokenization-vs-embedding.png)\n",
    "*Example of **tokenization** (straight mapping from word to number) and **embedding** (richer representation of relationships between tokens).*\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Question:** What level of tokenzation should I use? What embedding should should I choose?\n",
    "\n",
    "It depends on your problem. You could try character-level tokenization/embeddings and word-level tokenization/embeddings and see which perform best. You might even want to try stacking them (e.g. combining the outputs of your embedding layers using [`tf.keras.layers.concatenate`](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/layers/concatenate)). \n",
    "\n",
    "If you're looking for pre-trained word embeddings, [Word2vec embeddings](http://jalammar.github.io/illustrated-word2vec/), [GloVe embeddings](https://nlp.stanford.edu/projects/glove/) and many of the options available on [TensorFlow Hub](https://tfhub.dev/s?module-type=text-embedding) are great places to start.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Note:** Much like searching for a pre-trained computer vision model, you can search for pre-trained word embeddings to use for your problem. Try searching for something like \"use pre-trained word embeddings in TensorFlow\"."

    "* `input_dim` - The size of the vocabulary (e.g. `len(text_vectorizer.get_vocabulary()`).\n",
    "* `output_dim` - The size of the output embedding vector, for example, a value of `100` outputs a  feature vector of size 100 for each word.\n",
    "* `embeddings_initializer` - How to initialize the embeddings matrix, default is `\"uniform\"` which randomly initalizes embedding matrix with uniform distribution. This can be changed for using pre-learned embeddings.\n",

    "\n",
    "The premise of an RNN is simple: use information from the past to help you with the future (this is where the term recurrent comes from). In other words, take an input (`X`) and compute an output (`y`) based on all previous inputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "This concept is especially helpful when dealing with sequences such as passages of natural language text (such as our Tweets).\n",

    "I put the word \"dog\" at the end which is a valid word but it doesn't make sense in the context of the rest of the sentence.\n",
    "\n",
    "When an RNN looks at a sequence of text (already in numerical form), the patterns it learns are continually updated based on the order of the sequence. \n",
    "\n",
    "For a simple example, take two sentences:\n",
    "1. Massive earthquake last week, no?\n",
    "2. No massive earthquake last week.\n",
    "\n",
    "Both contain exactly the same words but have different meaning. The order of the words determines the meaning (one could argue punctuation marks also dictate the meaning but for simplicity sake, let's stay focused on the words).\n",
    "\n",
    "Recurrent neural networks can be used for a number of sequence-based problems:\n",
    "* **One to one:** one input, one output, such as image classification.\n",
    "* **One to many:** one input, many outputs, such as image captioning (image input, a sequence of text as caption output).\n",
    "* **Many to one:** many inputs, one outputs, such as text classification (classifying a Tweet as real diaster or not real diaster).\n",
    "* **Many to many:** many inputs, many outputs, such as machine translation (translating English to Spanish) or speech to text (audio wave as input, text as output).\n",
    "\n",
    "When you come across RNN's in the wild, you'll most likely come across variants of the following:\n",
    "* Long short-term memory cells (LSTMs).\n",
    "* Gated recurrent units (GRUs).\n",
    "* Bidirectional RNN's (passes forward and backward along a sequence, left to right and right to left).\n",
    "\n",
    "Going into the details of each these is beyond the scope of this notebook (we're going to focus on using them instead), the main thing you should know for now is that they've proven very effective at modelling sequences.\n",

The `text_vectorizer` layer can be reused since it doesn't get updated during training.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **NOTE:** **The reason we use a new embedding layer for each model is since the embedding layer is a *learned* representation of words (as numbers), if we were to use the same embedding layer (`embedding_1`) for each model, we'd be mixing what one model learned with the next. And because we want to compare our models later on, starting them with their own embedding layer each time is a better idea.**"

    "So to use CNNs with sequences, we use a 1-dimensional convolution instead of a 2-dimensional convolution.\n",

    "\n",
    "And you'd be right.\n",
    "\n",
    "The difference again is in the layers component. Instead of using an LSTM or GRU cell, we're going to use a [`tensorflow.keras.layers.Conv1D()`](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/layers/Conv1D) layer followed by a [`tensorflow.keras.layers.GlobablMaxPool1D()`](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/layers/GlobalMaxPool1D) layer.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Resource:** The intuition here is explained succinctly in the paper [*Understanding Convolutional Neural Networks for Text Classification*](https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/W18-5408.pdf), where they state that CNNs classify text through the following steps:\n",
    "1. 1-dimensional convolving filters are used as ngram detectors, each filter specializing in a closely-related family of ngrams (an ngram is a collection of n-words, for example, an ngram of 5 might result in \"hello, my name is Daniel\").\n",
    "2. Max-pooling over time extracts the relevant ngrams for making a decision.\n",
    "3. The rest of the network classifies the text based on this information.\n",

    "## Combining our models (model ensembling/stacking)\n",
    "\n",
    "Many production systems use an **ensemble** (multiple different models combined) of models to make a prediction.\n",
    "\n",
    "The idea behind model stacking is that if several uncorrelated models agree on a prediction, then the prediction must be more robust than a prediction made by a singular model.\n",
    "\n",
    "The keyword in the sentence above is **uncorrelated**, which is another way of saying, different types of models. For example, in our case, we might combine our baseline, our bidirectional model and our TensorFlow Hub USE model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Although these models are all trained on the same data, they all have a different way of finding patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we were to use three similarly trained models, such as three LSTM models, the predictions they output will likely be very similar.\n",
    "\n",
    "Think of it as trying to decide where to eat with your friends. If you all have similar tastes, you'll probably all pick the same restaurant. But if you've all got different tastes and still end up picking the same restaurant, the restaurant must be good.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since we're working with a classification problem, there are a few of ways we can combine our models:\n",
    "1. **Averaging** - Take the output prediction probabilities of each model for each sample, combine them and then average them.\n",
    "2. **Majority vote (mode)** - Make class predictions with each of your models on all samples, the predicted class is the one in majority. For example, if three different models predict `[1, 0, 1]` respectively, the majority class is `1`, therefore, that would be the predicted label.\n",
    "3. **Model stacking** - Take the outputs of each of your chosen models and use them as inputs to another model.\n",
    "\n",
    "> 📖 **Resource:** The above methods for model stacking/ensembling were adapted from Chapter 6 of the [Machine Learning Engineering Book](http://www.mlebook.com/wiki/doku.php) by Andriy Burkov. If you're looking to enter the field of machine learning engineering, not only building models but production-scale machine learning systems, I'd highly recommend reading it in its entirety.\n",
    "\n",
    "Again, the concept of model stacking is best seen in action.\n",
    "\n",
    "We're going to combine our baseline model (`model_0`), LSTM model (`model_2`) and our USE model trained on the full training data (`model_6`) by averaging the combined prediction probabilities of each."

    "Put it this way, imagine you're Twitter and receive 1 million Tweets per hour (this is a made up number, the actual number is much higher). And you're trying to build a diaster detection system to read Tweets and alert authorities with details about a diaster in close to real-time.\n",

    "Which model do you choose?\n",
    "\n",
    "Is the second model's performance boost worth missing out on the extra capacity?\n",

    "Of course, there are many options you could try here, such as sending as many Tweets as possible to the first model and then sending the ones which the model is least certain of to the second model. \n",

    "The point here is to illustrate the best model you find through experimentation, might not be the model you end up using in production.\n",
    "\n",
    "To make this more concrete, let's write a function to take a model and a number of samples and time how long the given model takes to make predictions on those samples."
